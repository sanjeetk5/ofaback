### Tech Stack
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that compiles to clean JavaScript output.
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/) - Node Framweork.

- [Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) - Use for development file reload.
- [CORS](https://github.com/expressjs/cors) - a node.js package for providing a Connect/Express middleware that can be used to enable CORS with various options.

- [Winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston) - A multi-transport async logging library for node.js.

- [mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) - ODM library for mongoDB.
- [Helmet](https://helmetjs.github.io/) - Library to increase security of node server.

### Logging
- [winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston) - a multi-transport async logging library for Node.js. It is designed to be a simple and universal logging library with support for multiple transports. A transport is essentially a storage device for your logs. Each instance of a winston logger can have multiple transports configured at different levels. For example, one may want error logs to be stored in a persistent remote location (like a database), but all logs output to the console or a local file.
- [morgan](https://github.com/expressjs/morgan) - HTTP request logger middleware for Node.js. A helper that collects logs from your server, such as your request logs.

### Tests
- [mocha](https://mochajs.org/) - Test Framweork for JavaScript.
- [chai](https://github.com/nodkz/mongodb-memory-server) - Assertion library for javascript.
